======================
Swift Specs Repository
======================

This is a git repository for doing design review on enhancements to
OpenStack Swift.  This provides an ability to ensure that everyone
has signed off on the approach to solving a problem early on.

Repository Structure
====================
The expected structure of the respository is as follows::

  specs/
      swift/
      swift-bench/
      swiftclient/

Implemented specs will be moved to an ``implemented`` directory
under the respective project directory.

Revisiting Specifications
=========================
We don't always get everything right the first time. If we realize we
need to revisit a specification because something changed, either we
now know more, or a new idea came in which we should embrace, we'll
manage this by proposing an update to the specification in question.

Learn As We Go
==============
This is a new way of attempting things, so we're going to be low in
process to begin with to figure out where we go from here. Expect some
early flexibility in evolving this effort over time.
