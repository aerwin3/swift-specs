.. _done-directory:

The ``Done`` Directory
======================

This directory in the specs repo is where specs are moved once the
associated code patch has been merged into its respective repo.

Historical Reference
--------------------

A spec document in this directory is meant only for historical
reference, it does not equate to docs for the feature.  Swift's
documentation for implemented features is published
`here <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/swift/>`_.
